# HIL Simulation Assignment
## scope 
The goal of this simulation is to improve the line following behavior of our robot so it can only follow the outer most line of the field and being able to return on the black line when it goes away from it. we will also implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on the map, programed in micropython.
